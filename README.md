# CourseScheduler Project

Designed a Course Scheduler GUI using Java in the Netbeans IDE, Apache Derby Databases, and SQL to help schedule classes and manage courses.

Key Features:
1. Allows users to create accounts and manage their respective classes/schedules, saved in the database.
2. Can display the current schedule of a student.
3. Allows students to add/drop classes.
4. Admin mode to add/delete classes for students to enroll in.


OVerall a good practice for frontend dev, java, and SQL to help get me some beginner experience.
